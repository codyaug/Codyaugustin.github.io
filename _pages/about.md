## About Me
I am a highly skilled and experienced data analyst with two years of professional experience and a solid background in mathematics and finance. I am well-versed in discovering data-driven solutions and efficiently organizing, modeling, visualizing, and analyzing data to uncover valuable insights. My expertise includes time-series analysis, Bayesian analysis, logistic and linear regression, and decision tree approaches. I am proficient in several relevant libraries including TensorFlow, Keras, Numpy, Pandas, Scikit-learn (Sklearn), Mathplotlib, seaborn, selenium, BeautifulSoup, and FastAPI.

I hold a Bachelor of Science in Applied Mathematics from York College of the City University of New York, with a focus on Applied Mathematics & Operational Research. My skills include SQL, Tableau, Microsoft Excel, R programming, MATLAB, Python programming, analytics, data management, data science, and being multilingual.

# [Forecast Amazon ASIN Rankings](https://github.com/codyaug/Forecast-Amazon-ASIN-Rankings/blob/main/README.md)

This project analyzes a monthly report data by loading it into a Pandas DataFrame from a CSV file named "monthly_report.csv". The frequency of each ASIN is counted and plotted as a bar graph. The report data is then grouped by keyword and the frequency of each keyword is calculated and plotted as a trend graph. An ARIMA model is trained on the keyword data to forecast future trends and the forecasted trend is plotted. A decision tree is trained on the ASIN data to predict future rankings and the predicted rankings of each ASIN are plotted in a scatter plot.

## [Dow Jones Industrial Average Prediction](https://github.com/codyaug/Dow-Jones-Industrial-Average-Prediction)


This codes perform time series analysis on the historical daily closing price of the US30 index, using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network. The data is pre-processed to scale the values between 0 and 1, then the model is trained on a portion of the data. The remaining data is used for testing and validation, with the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) being used to evaluate the accuracy of the model's predictions. The model is then used to predict the closing price of the US30 index on a specific date (2022-06-29). The predictions and actual values are visualized and compared in a line plot.

### [Youtube Channel Analyst](https://github.com/codyaug/Vice-youtube-analyst/blob/main/README.md)


This code uses the Google API Client library for Python to access YouTube API and retrieve information about a YouTube channel and its videos. It retrieves statistics about the channel such as its title, number of subscribers, number of views, and the total number of videos. It also retrieves video ids from a playlist. The code also makes use of the dateutil library to parse dates, the pandas library to handle data, and the Seaborn, Matplotlib, Nltk, and wordcloud libraries for data visualization and NLP tasks.
